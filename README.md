# Floating Message Bubbles

This application is a video comment overlay tool, inspired by [craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog) (Takuya Matsuyama). Takuya demonstrated his video creation process on his channel ([video](https://youtu.be/zu_vqAWHy_E?si=0_E3y6meoqjUgJKV)), where he utilized a self-built floating message bubble system. Although his repository was previously public, it is no longer available.

My intention is to launch a YouTube channel with a similar style to Takuya's, where I use on-screen comments instead of my voice to convey thoughts.

Therefore, I decided to develop a similar floating message bubble application using JavaScript and React. This application is designed to integrate with a video player, enabling users to add comments that appear as dynamic, floating bubbles over the video content.

The green background facilitates easy chroma keying, allowing for seamless integration of screen recordings into video projects.

This project is currently under active development. Future enhancements include optimizing the message expiration time; I believe Takuya's version dynamically adjusted expiration based on message length, whereas my current implementation uses a fixed 15-second duration. Additionally, the visual style of the message bubbles will be improved in the coming weeks.
